#Project goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

#Tech stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

#Team roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

#Database Design
1. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
3. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
4. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
5. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

#API security
Authentication & Authorization

Use OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Implement API keys (for simple access control)

Enforce role-based access control (RBAC)

Encryption & Secure Communication

Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL)

Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest

APIs are prime targets for cyberattacks. A breach can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage. By implementing strong security measures, organizations can ensure safe, reliable, and compliant API operations.

#CI/CD Pipeline
 is a DevOps practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications.
 They are important because: 
1.They automate testing and deployment, reducing manual errors.
2.Improved Code Quality
3.Consistency

Tools
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI
